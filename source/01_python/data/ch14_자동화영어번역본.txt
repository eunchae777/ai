Perhaps that's why people have been afraid of tigers, but at the same time respecting and friendly.
However, real-life tigers are endangered due to habitat destruction and illegal hunting.
Fortunately, conservation activities are being actively carried out, and some regions are regaining their prestige again.
I hope someday tigers will live freely in nature.
