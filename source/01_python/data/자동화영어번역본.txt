Hello, tigers, a symbol of eye strength and valor, have long impressed people. The combination of golden hair with black stripes overwhelms the surroundings with just one glance. Tigers are top predators with excellent hunting abilities, but they also have a warm side to take care of their young. In fact, mother tigers do not leave their cubs until they become self-reliant, and sometimes risk their lives to protect their families. Tigers in our culture are not just predators, but they appear as guardians of villages and wise beings in folktales
